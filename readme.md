Welcome to the little game called Crimbo!
It was created by me to learn some Lua and also to make a DOS game.
It runs on both DosBox and actual retro hardware.

    What the project does:
	It showcases making a simple 2d platform game using Lua in the DOS environment.

    Why the project is useful
	For others to learn about using LoveDOS (Lua for DOS) to make DOS-based games.

Hope you learn something fun looking at this!
