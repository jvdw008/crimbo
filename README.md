Welcome to the little game called Crimbo!
It was created by me to learn some Lua and also to make a DOS game.
It runs on both DosBox and actual retro hardware.

What the project does:
- It showcases making a simple 2d platform game using Lua in the DOS environment.

Why the project is useful:
- For others to learn about using LoveDOS (Lua for DOS) to make DOS-based games.

How to run LoveDOS:
- Open DosBox. Create the settings to point to where your game folder is, then when you run DosBox, type "love gameFolderName" (without the quotes)
- For more info, check out the LoveDOS repo at https://github.com/rxi/lovedos

Hope you learn something fun looking at this!
